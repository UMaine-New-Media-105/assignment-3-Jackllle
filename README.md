In the First assignment I made a little pixel guy from a manga I like called "Beserk". In the second part of the assignment I had mad my pixel change to a jumping version if the mouse was pressed. In the third part of the assignment I made it so there is a ground and the sprite can move with the Mouse's X axis. for the fourht part of the assignment I made collision and added a score. The final part of the assignment I added a little overlay signaling if you collected the egg.
